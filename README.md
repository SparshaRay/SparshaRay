<h1 align="center"> Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sparsh </h1>

I am a 4th year undergraduate student majoring in physics at [IISER Mohali](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/).

I am fascinated by astrophysics, nonlinear dynamics, and computer science. And I love to play around with generative art too!

The above GIF is a particle mesh simulation of a body of fluid around a massive point object. It is generated by the Folfox code (being designed and developed jointly by me, Rajnil, and Eshna) for simulation of self-gravitating fluids.

Thank you for stopping by!
