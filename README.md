I am a 2nd year undergraduate student at [IISER, Mohali](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/).

I am fascinated by astrophysics, mathematics, and computer science. And I love to play around with generative art too! Here you will find some of the stuff I made with ❤️. Hope you like it! 

Thank you for stopping by 🍀
